# Learn JavaScript with Eko Khannedy

This repository contains materials from my learning journey in Fundamental JavaScript with Mr. Eko Khannedy. In this section, I learned the basics of programming using JavaScript, including concepts such as variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, and functions. I also explored how to use features like `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt`, apply concepts such as scope and strict mode, and handle errors using `try...catch`.

I also learned about advanced JavaScript concepts like optional chaining, rest parameters, template literals, and iterables. These fundamentals helped me understand how JavaScript controls the logic and interactivity of web applications effectively.

Additionally, the repository includes a section on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript, where I studied concepts such as classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. I practiced using class features such as public and private fields, getters and setters, static methods, and method overriding. I also explored prototype-based inheritance and learned how to structure my code into reusable components and maintain clean architecture using modern JavaScript class syntax. 

This knowledge is essential for building scalable and maintainable web applications.
